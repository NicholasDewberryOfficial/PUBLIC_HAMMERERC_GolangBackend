#What's this? 

This repository is a temporary slice of the backend present in a DT  I've developed. This version goes back to September 2024. This is because my most recent version of this program (Feb 2025) contains sensitive information, ugly and non-robust security features and more problems that I need to fix. 

Currently, I'm taking a break before I start my PhD in Fall 2025, and I'll update this once I start it. 

The other half is located here: https://github.com/NicholasDewberryOfficial/HammerERCVRDTUnityFiles
