#What's this? 

This repository is a temporary slice of the backend present in a DT  I've developed. This version goes back to September 2024. This is because my most recent version of this program (Feb 2025) contains sensitive information, ugly and non-robust security features and more problems that I need to fix. 

Note: The commit says "December 2024" but I actually meant "September 2024". This discrepancy is because I misread and misremembered. 

Currently, I'm taking a break before I start my PhD in Fall 2025, and I'll update this once I start it.
